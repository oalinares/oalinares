Hi, I’m @oalinares (Oscar Linares), and I’m interested in Java, MySQL, and Spring Boot! And I’m currently learning Java, MySQL, and Spring Boot! On my future
plans with collaborations would be to engage in projects that will further expand my skills, and further my education. Currently, I have no side projects in 
coding, but I hope to have future repositories filled with code ranging from arcade games to programming in limiting food waste.
